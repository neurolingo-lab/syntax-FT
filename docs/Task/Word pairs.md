## Reversible word pairs
- Eliminates effects of different semantic targets for stimuli between conditions, so that “our dog” vs. “dog our” data differences are due to syntax only
- Closed class less prone to coercion into a semantic context versus adj. noun pairs reversed. Latter may still be possible.
- Restricts us to a small subset of possible word pairs, especially with closed class and to a lesser ext with adj noun

## Pseudo- vs non-words

We only use non-words for cleanliness of the point we will make with the data available to us, as pseudo-words can be coerced into several syntactic categories based on similarity to known words, and the relationship of the preceding/following word in the pair

## Foveal angle for stimuli

The definitive center of the fovea is $5\degree$ while the area between $5\degree \text{to}  \; 9\degree$ is considered the parafovea and can possibly introduce complications in analyzing the data.

We will align the words using their inner edges, relative to the fixation dot at the center, and choose a font size such that the outer edge of the largest word we use touches the $5\degree$ bound of the fovea
