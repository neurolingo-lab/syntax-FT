Similar in spirit to [Alp et al 2016](Alp%20et%20al%202016.md), and likely a predecessor to that work.

The paper uses a similar system of frequency-tagged circles with cutouts (pacmen) to create illusory contours in the shape of a rectangle. Unlike the Alp paper, however, there are only two pacmen to cue the rectangle (with U-shaped cutouts), and the formation of the illusory contour is disrupted by a visual cue rather than a rotation or manipulation of the pacmen themselves:

The pacmen were tagged at 8.5 and 14.17 Hz and subjects were asked to discriminate changes in the height of the opening of each pacman. 

Intermodulation responses were only observed when the central blocking circle allowed for the contour of the rectangle, illustrating the selective nature of IMs in visual integration
