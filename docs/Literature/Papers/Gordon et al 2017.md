### SSVEPs and SWIFT used to examine attention and predictive coding

Semantic Wavelet-Induced Frequency Tagging (SWIFT) was used in combination with normal contrast modulation of stimuli in this experiment to examine the interactions between top-down signals of prediction error and bottom-up stimulus infomation.

Gordon and colleagues go on to call this method "Hierarchical Frequency Tagging" (HFT), in which multiple tags are used for different levels of the task.

SWIFT relies on using shifting coherence in a presented image via contour scrambling in the wavelet domain (See [Koenig-Robert et al 2013](Koenig-Robert%20et%20al%202013.md) for specifications). 

Trials were conducted using a mixture of faces and houses as stimuli, with the images emerging from the scrambled wavelet base of the stimuli as their features cohered:

In addition a global contrast modulation on the whole image was applied during presentation to evoked a second frequency tag. A SWIFT tag of 1.3 Hz and sinusoidal tag of 10 Hz were used together as subjects were asked to count how many stimuli for a chosen category (house, face) appeared over the course of the experiment.

The base tags were both observed strongly in the data, with peak SNR of 6.5 for the SSVEP tag and 2.3 for the SWIFT tag. Intermodulation responses also emerged for the two frequencies, with a peak SNR of 1.5 but strong localization:

During the course of trials the frequency of stimulus categories was changed. In some trials the chosen category for reporting would be a large majority of the stimuli, while in others it was close to 50/50.

The authors categorized these as "high-certainty" and "low-certainty" trials, and compared response in the frequency tag bands based on the category of trial. They found that the SSVEP responses did not change substantially while the SWIFT responses and IM responses were modulated by certainty, though with opposite signs:

Swift responses to the wavelet tag decreased with category certainty, while the intermodulation components became strong with the same. The authors suggest that this is because SWIFT reflects top-down signals related to prediction error (since it's occurring as a semantic, not cosmetic, tag on the stimulus), and with a lower prediction error results in decreased weighting of those signals. They cite [Koenig-Robert et al 2013](Koenig-Robert%20et%20al%202013.md) for the claim that SWIFT selectively engages regions involved in processing semantic information.

They go on to claim that the increasing IM responses with certainty reflect an increasing efficiency of integration of the top-down signals tagged via SWIFT and the bottom-up sensory information tagged via SSVEP.
