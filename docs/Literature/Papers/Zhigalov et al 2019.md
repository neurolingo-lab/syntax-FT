### Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging

The paper mostly serves as a proof-of-concept for high-frequency cosmetic tags using luminance/contrast. There are methodological curiosities (they use a tag frequency with a non-whole-number frame count per cycle, instead sampling a sinusoid at each frame) but it serves to show that at the very least tags above 30 Hz produce robust primary responses.

Subjects were shown pairs of images (house/face) tagged at 63 Hz and 78 Hz using a sinusoid. Responses were recorded with MEG and analyzed.

Tag frequencies showed robust activation:

but crucially showed substantial modulation with attention, coupled to the alpha band. Using an index of attention computed using the alpha band in occipital sensors for left versus right, the frequency tagged followed the modulation of alpha in power:

NB: AMI is attention modulation index.

The clear relationship between the two is worth noting, though may not necessarily impact our work.
