### Perceptual dominance and SSVEP

Study investigated the changing amplitude of an SSVEP during a binocular rivalry task.

Subjects were shown a contrast-grating ring in one eye and a face in the other eye. The ring would change size at a fixed frequency (5 Hz per cycle of large to small and back) while the face would remain completely static. 

Subjects were asked to report via button presses which image (ring/face) was dominant in their vision. Subject reported on average 2.3s of dominance for the rings, while the face averaged 2.02s. Each viewing lasted 2 minutes (120s), EOG was used to reject periods with eye movement for a total of ~80s on average per trial.

Frequency peaks in the spectrum from the MEG recording showed clear increases during the periods in which subjects reported ring visual dominance, and the peak of the SNR followed the reported dominance very closely. Responses were localized to visual cortex as well as temporal and occipital regions (particularly during dominance).

The authors make an argument for the use of FT approaches in non-averaged conditions in order to track the evolving state of the brain as subjects change internal state.
