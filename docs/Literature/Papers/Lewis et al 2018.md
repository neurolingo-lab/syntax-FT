### Frequency tag reactivation through recall

The paper shows, in brief, that it's possible to elicit frequency-tagged responses when asking subjects to recall previously observed FT stimuli.

The effects are weak and the study concludes that they're not a reliable index of lexical activation, but it's a neat finding.

Subjects were shown a set of 100 words in dutch which were frequency-tagged using a flickering background and asked to judge whether the word was concrete or conceptual (e.g. bird versus revenge). Following a flanker task they were again presented words, this time without the background flicker, and asked if they had seen the words before in part 1.

EEG recordings showed reactivation of the frequency band of the tag during the recall task despite the lack of a stimulus tag:

The ITC was used as a metric for the frequency tag, and showed clear increases even during the recognition phase in brief bursts. 

The authors conclude, however, that this isn't a robust metric (whose absence can be used to conclude a lack of lexical access) because of the sensitivity of the method to choice of multiple comparisons correction.

All in all a neat study with major caveats for implementation in future work.
