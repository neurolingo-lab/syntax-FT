Papers related to biomarkers of DLD and similar language disorders:
- [Campos et al 2025](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/15/3/219) : No difference at all in resting-state EEG power or lateralization between DLD and healthy cohort children, but a change in the theta/alpha band ratio was observed between the two groups as an incidental finding. This ratio has been implicated in ADHD, AD, Parkinsons as a biomarker of cognitive dysfunction. Did not remain significant after multiple-comparisons corrections.
- [Xu et al 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1358167/full) : Overview of biomarkers in various forms of cognitive impairment from MCI, AD, and other forms of cognitive impairment. Found that severe cognitive impairment was easily distinguishable from other groups but mild and moderate impairment did not differ from normal controls or one another substantially. Analyzed resting state EEG data and compared activity in different frequency bands.
- [Proteau-Lemieux et al 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11382468/) : Resting-state study of fragile X syndrome and ASD patients. Compared alpha peak frequency and signal complexity (?) between disorders and healthy controls. FXS patients showed lower complexity and APF relative to other two groups (plus altered power in theta, alpha, low gamma) while ASD **showed exaggerated beta** relative to other groups, and enhanced high/low gamma power. FXS results disappeared when controlling for non-verbal intelligence quotient.
- [Piazza et al 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223010647) : ASD was associated with decreased power spectral response in resting-state EEG in delta and theta bands during 6-12 months of age, while **DLD was associated with increased high-alpha/beta/gamma power at 12 months w.r.t. non-diagnosed infants**. 
- [Abbott and Love 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10670267/) : A wide-ranging literature survey of findings related to biomarkers and DLD. **Worth a deep dive**. 
	- Notes that methodological differences, particularly regarding grouping by age and subtype of DLD, leads to a wide variety of conflicting results for biomarkers. Grouping precisely by age, diagnostic criteria, methodology, and phenotype is crucial!
	- Gray matter volume in the inferior frontal gyrus, planum temporale, and caudate nucleus is linked to DLD diagnoses, but the direction of the change in volume in DLD groups is not clear due to methodological differences between studies.
	- White matter connectivity research in DLD patients is limited, work in other disorders including ASD, dyslexia, epilepsy, and reading disorders has shown a link between WM alterations and functional impairment. White matter **volume** studies are also limited but have been performed in DLD and found that under 12 years of age increased WM is linked to functional impairment.
	- White matter diffusivity in the dorsal white matter pathway is characterized in a handful of studies as being abnormal w.r.t. control groups, with lower myelination. Similar results have been seen in the ventral pathway, along with a lack of lateralization typical of normal language development.
	- fMRI studies have shown **reduced activation in the IFG in DLD individuals** with a stronger bilateral signature compared to healthy cohorts. **Reduced STG/STS activation (where the planum temporale is) and increased subcortical activity also accompany DLD**. Like the anatomical work, this is a fuzzy finding with inconsistent results between studies.
	- **It doesn't mention EEG studies and does not address them.** Why? It's not really motivated.
- [Nikolaeva et al 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X24000853) : **High gamma power** in toddlers was found to be associated with whether the toddler was a **late talker** or not, but the gamma power did not have a strong relationship with a continuous measure of expressive language. Cites previous studies which show a strong **positive correlation of gamma with expressive language ability in healthy children, but a strong negative correlation in ASD individuals**.
- [Benasich et al 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432808004993?via%3Dihub) showed a robust correlation between resting gamma power and both language and cognitive skill at 16, 24, and 36 months of age. Gamma power was lower for children with a family history of language impairment compared to those without. This is replicated in rural pakistani children by [Tarullo et al 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929316301876?via%3Dihub) in resting EEG. 
- [Chinn et al 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20438-7) : Found that **auditory brainstem response** was a weak predictor of both LD and DLD, with longer latencies in ABR waves III, V and A plus reduced amplitude in waves V and A. Multi-level analysis with comparison correction showed these to be not significant but the authors drew conclusions anyways.
- [Gul et al 2023](https://jneurodevdisorders.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s11689-023-09481-1) : **Task-related EEG responses** were examined during a item classification task for DLD and TD groups. DLD subjects showed a stronger theta response to negative feedback but no difference in the ERP. While TD participants had test performances predicted well by delta activity, DLD subjects had no correlation b/w delta and other variables. Finally, both theta and delta activities weren't associated with learning outcomes for DLD children.
- [Keshavarzi et al 2024](https://jneurodevdisorders.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s11689-023-09481-1) : Examined EEG responses in a **rhythmic speech task** to study the relationship between phase-amplitude coupling, phase-phase coupling, ERPs, angular velocity, power, and DLD diagnosis. Saw decrease in gamma phase entrainment from TD to DLD, but similar delta/theta entrainment (not PAC). Increase in theta and gamma power in DLD as well. All-in-all confusing as hell in light of previously mentioned papers on resting state, but maybe we can chalk it up to task-related changes in activation
- [Araujo et al 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.26.513864v1.full) : Used speech-listening EEG to differentiate dyslexic and DLD children. Found that atypical power spectrum dynamics characterized dyslexia while DLD was characterized by changes in delta/theta phase-amplitude coupling which starkly contrasts with the Keshavarzi study previously.
- The Keshavarzi study notes that almost no work has been done with frequency-tracking tasks in DLD populations, notably citing the Araujo study as one of the only ones along with [Attaheri et al 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.02.514963v4) which showed that the ratio of theta to delta power increased with worse language outcomes. WTF is this mess?
