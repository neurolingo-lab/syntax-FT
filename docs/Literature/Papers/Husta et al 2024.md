### Multimodal RIFT experiment with language

The study, in brief, sought to look at IM responses with high-frequency tagged stimuli. A picture of an object was shown after fixation while simultaneously an audio sample of a spoken word was played. In congruent trials the word spoken was categorically related to the picture, while incongruent trials had no relation. Subjects would then after 1s of presentation name the object in the picture.

The IM response at 14 Hz (68 Hz visual tag, 54 Hz AM auditory) was visible in trials with mild differing amplitude for congruent vs incongruent trials:

All-in-all it's a quite short paper lacking much in the way of results (only one other figure besides these two, and it doesn't contain much addtl. info) but shows at least that in the language domain cosmetic FT has been used.

Worth noting that they don't mention the actual SNR of their data (although the max. 70% increase in power means an SNR of roughly 1.7) and I suspect the strength of the signal is much, much lower.
