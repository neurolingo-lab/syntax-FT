### Steady-state responses

Multi-modal stimulation has shown that SSRs are reproducible with a strong signal--to-noise ratio and can be observed at many different frequencies and modalities: Both visual periodic stimulation and auditory stimulation with either repeated stimulation or modulation produce SSRs

In fact, in multi-modal stimulation with both visual and auditory components interactions can be weakly observed in intermodulation frequencies, though the  study in question ( [Giani et al 2012](../Giani%20et%20al%202012.md) ) did not have a sufficient sample size to draw strong conclusions.

Intermodulation responses extend even to cognitive functions such as attention and expectation ( [Gordon et al 2019](../Gordon%20et%20al%202019.md) ), have been used in BCI work ( Chen et al. 2013 ), and can be elicited by illusions ( [Alp et al 2016](../Alp%20et%20al%202016.md) ).

It is possible to tag stimuli both cosmetically, as in the classic contrast-modulated visual stimulus, as well as with a static frequency of presentation (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation). Some methods combine the two methods in order to look for interactions between processing and stimuli ( [Gordon et al 2017](../Gordon%20et%20al%202017.md) ). 

Furthermore the magnitude of the SSR can be shown to reflect perceptual dominance in vision, with the dominant stimulus exhibiting a stronger SNR ( [Cosmelli et al 2004](../Cosmelli%20et%20al%202004.md) )
