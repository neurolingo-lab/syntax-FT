### Motion as a tool for perceptual tagging

Subjects were presented two pairs of horizontal/vertical bars that moved inwards and outwards relative to a central fixation point. Responses when the bars became close enough to trigger an illusion of a complete square were examined relative to the points at which they did not "complete the square".

Both the length and luminance of the bars would change between trials, as seen above. Within a trial the luminance/length would remain static but the bars would oscillate at two separate frequencies:

The horizontal bars moved vertically at $\mathbf{f}_1 = 2.3 \; \text{Hz}$  while the vertical bars moved at $\mathbf{f}_2 = 3 \; \text{Hz}$. 

Subjects generally reported consistent observations such that low line-end luminance led to bound perception and high luminance led to unbound perception (pairs of moving lines).

The major takeaways from the study are that while the power at intermodulation frequency $2\mathbf{f}_1 + 2\mathbf{f}_2$  can be used to reliably predict the bound versus unbound state of the illusory percept, a previously-reported ( Singer and Gray 1995, Tallon-Baudry and Betrand 1999, Varela et al 2001 ) studies showing gamma-band synchronization during illusory binding were not replicated here. The gamma band showed little to no additional activity when the percept was bound.
