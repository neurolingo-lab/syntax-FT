### Intermodulation responses to illusory figures

The study looks at the perception of illusory features in negative space (using the ubiquitous pacmen stimuli) to examine regions involved in illusory perception.

Opposite corners of the pacmen were tagged with different frequency (3.57 Hz, 2.94 Hz) flickers, and the orientation of each individual stimulus was rotated during the course of a trial to produce an illusory percept:

Responses recorded by EEG showed clear peaks at each of the two tag frequencies, along with intermodulation frequencies $f_2 - f_1$, $f_1 + f_2$, $2f_2 - f_1$, $2f_1 + f_2$, and $f_1 + 2f_2$.

SNS responses are baseline-corrected for the 1/F noise in the frequency spectrum.

Intermodulation frequencies showed higher responses in the sensor space during the illusory condition as opposed to the non-illusory condition:

Particularly noteworthy is the involvement of frontal sensors that is absent in the non-illusory stimulus.
