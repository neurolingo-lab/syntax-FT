# An objective signature for visual binding of face parts in the human brain

**Boromanse, Norcia & Rossion 2013**

Key points:

- Pictures of faces were split in to two halves, each tagged at separate frequencies
- Intermodulation components of two frequencies observed when the halves were aligned, misaligned, or had a gap.
- IM frequencies were strongest in the whole-face condition, and at chance SNR in other conditions

Stimulus details:

- 5.88 Hz and 7.14 Hz stimuli used (sinusoidal contrast modulation)
- 100 Hz monitor constrained choices of frequencies.
- 4 Hz to 9 Hz stimulation cited from separate paper with Norcia & Rossion to show greatest response when changing face identity at that frequency ([Alonso-Prieto et al 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.08.018)).
    - Not sure how this applies to the single-face stimulation used here, but since it's the same lab they were likely already set up to do that frequency and wanted consistency.
- 12 trials, 70 seconds each to provide high frequency resolution in FFT. Each of the 3 condition trial types were averaged together in analysis across the 70 seconds.

Analysis details:

- SNR computed on trial-averaged condition data at frequencies of interest for EEG per-subject
- Spectra computed, then averaged across subjects
