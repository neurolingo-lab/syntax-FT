# Summer 2025 Language FT literature search

The project will consist of looking for papers using whatever means you prefer (google, pubmed, etc) related to two key topics:
- **Papers related to written language stimuli**: We need papers which use visual, not auditory, stimuli of language. Written text, whether single words or whole sentences, is key.
- **Papers which use _frequency tagging_**: We want papers using the above stimuli in a frequency-tagging paradigm, i.e. a task in which the stimuli are modulated at a fixed frequency. This can take the form of a Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) or an "oddball" paradigm. The SSVEP involves modulating the contrast or luminance of the stimulus at a fixed frequency (dim --> bright --> dim in a fixed duration). The oddball paradigm involves presenting a stream of stimuli at some rate, e.g. 5 Hz, and every $K^{\text{th}}$ element is of a different type (e.g. houses at 5Hz, but every 5th element is a face which would produce a "tag" of 1 Hz among a base rate of 5 HZ)
- **Papers recording data with EEG or MEG**

Additional methods to look for in the paper which are _nice-to-haves_ are:
- **Source reconstruction**: This involves using anatomical scans of the subject to transform the data from _sensor space_, i.e. the data as viewed at the sensors of the EEG/MEG, into _source space_, which is locations on or in the brain.
- **Intermodulation/Cross-modulation frequency analysis**: This method involves multiple stimuli with different frequency tags. In brain regions processing the stimuli the two "tags" will be present (i.e. we will see for two stimuli in the same region responses at $\mathbf{F}_1$ and $\mathbf{F}_2$), but uniquely in regions which integrate the two stimuli together additional frequencies that are linear combination of the two (e.g. $\mathbf{F}_1 + \mathbf{F}_2$) will also appear.

## Steps for you to follow

You will ideally follow the steps below when you find a new paper that might be relevant to the topics above:
1. Skim the abstract of the paper to see if it really includes everything we are looking for above. You may need to look into the first figure or methods section to be sure that they use EEG/MEG, frequency tagging, and visual text stimuli.
2. Check to see if the paper is already in the list of papers to exclude and refer to (shared separately)
3. Send it to me and get my go-ahead for a deep dive into the paper itself
4. Read the paper thoroughly for content. You will want to first and foremost understand the broad goals of the paper, then understand the task they used (and why they used it), followed by the main results and what data support them, and finally what the major takeaways from the paper are.
5. Write a summary of the paper in markdown format that encapsulates the key points in 4. You should consult me on your first paper as you write to get a gauge of how much detail is too much, and what is too little. 

Given that you lack a deep background knowledge of the paper, I'm not at all expecting you to fully understand the contents. As long as you understand how the authors justified their choices in the text, what they wanted to see, and whether they saw it we can call it a win.

## Key points to consider

1. You can reference my existing notes at [this link to the project GitHub](https://github.com/neurolingo-lab/syntax-FT/tree/main/docs/Literature/Papers). When viewing those notes you can click "Code" in the upper left-hand corner of the content pane to see the markdown source version of the document as well (if you want to use any styling I used).
2. [A guide to markdown syntax can be found here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). You should keep this guide up as you write, as it's extremely handy. If you want to insert images into the document, just send them to me along with the markdown (file ending in `.md`) and format the image link to refer to that file name. I'll handle the rest! **You should use a text editor that supports markdown previews.** This can be the GitHub web editor (create a repo and hit "create file", and you can switch to a preview as you write), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or any web-based markdown editor.
3. The aim here is for you to learn! Please ask me as many questions as you want. I know this is a tough ask, but it's a process that will serve you well no matter what career you go in to and make understanding popular science easier.
